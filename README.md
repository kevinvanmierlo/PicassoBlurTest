# PicassoBlurTest
Test project to show Picasso doesn't fade when image is loaded on disk.

When image is loaded from web it fades perfectly. Now the image is loaded on disk and for now in memory. When you close the app the image is removed from memory but remains on the disk. When starting the application again it will load the image from disk and should fade, but it doesn't.
